# Iris Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project applies a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier on the classic Iris dataset using scikit-learn. It demonstrates classification, visualization, and the impact of hyperparameter tuning on model performance.

## Project Overview

* Imported and explored the dataset with Pandas
* Visualized sepal and petal features using Matplotlib
* Split data into training and testing sets for evaluation
* Trained multiple SVM models with different configurations:

  * Default SVC
  * C parameter tuning
  * Gamma tuning
  * Linear kernel model
* Compared performance using accuracy scores across kernels

## Why SVM

Support Vector Machines are effective for classification tasks, especially when dealing with multi-class data. By adjusting hyperparameters like **C**, **gamma**, and **kernel type**, SVMs can adapt to different data complexities and improve decision boundary precision.

## Key Steps

1. Data exploration and visualization
2. Train-test split for robust evaluation
3. Model training with SVC under multiple configurations
4. Accuracy evaluation across kernels
5. Visualization of feature relationships
